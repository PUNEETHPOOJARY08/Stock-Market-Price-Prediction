 Stock Market Price Prediction 📈
 

This project was developed as part of our college coursework by me and my friends. The objective is to build a machine learning model that predicts future stock prices based on historical market data.

We have used various libraries and frameworks to implement and deploy our project, including:

# 🔧 Libraries and Tools Used:

  `streamlit` – for building and deploying the web application
  `yfinance` – to fetch historical stock market data
  `pandas`, `numpy` – for data manipulation and analysis
  `matplotlib`, `matplotlib-inline` – for data visualization
  `beautifulsoup4` – for web scraping additional stock-related data
  `scikit-learn` – for preprocessing and machine learning models
  `tensorflow`, `tensorflow-intel`, `keras`, `keras-models` – for building and training deep learning models

# 🚀 Features:

* Interactive Streamlit web interface
* Users can enter any **stock symbol** (e.g., AAPL, GOOGL, TSLA) to get predictions
* Real-time fetching of stock data using Yahoo Finance
* Visualization of historical stock trends
* Predictive model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for time series forecasting

# 🌐 Deployment:

The project is deployed using **Streamlit**. Simply enter the stock symbol on the web interface to get the predicted future prices.
